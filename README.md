# arXiv-Scraper
The [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) website is a platform where many scientists share the pre-prints to their publications. It is a great initiative by Cornell University Library that makes open source access to scientific publications possible. 
However the searching algorithm they have used for their archives is not the best and needs a lot of improvements. For example, you cannot search for papers published on a specific date in a specific category. So my collaborator and I decided to write a package that gives you the option to search for papers published between two dates in any of the main categories. This is still an ongoing project, and there is still a lot to do to make the front end more user friendly. We are also thinking to add the option to search for key words. The first version is deployed on Heroku and you can try it [here](https://arxiv-scraper.herokuapp.com) just to get a taste of what it does.
